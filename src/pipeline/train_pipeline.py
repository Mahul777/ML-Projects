# ðŸ”§ Purpose:
# This file acts as the main controller that links together:
# Data Ingestion
# Data Transformation
# Model Training
# Think of it as the "director" calling all the "actors" (components) to perform their roles in order.

# | File                | Role                                                               |
# | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
# | `train_pipeline.py` | Runs the full pipeline (ingest â†’ transform â†’ train â†’ save)         |

# ðŸ“¥ 1. Ingest (Data Ingestion)
# ðŸ‘‰ What it means:
