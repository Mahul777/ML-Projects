# ðŸ”§ Purpose:
# This file trains the machine learning model using the transformed data, evaluates its performance,
#  and saves the final model.

# | Accept Transformed Data | Takes preprocessed features and target from `data_transformation.py`.     |
# | Train Model             | Trains an ML model (e.g., Linear Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.) |
# | Evaluate Model          | Uses metrics like accuracy, F1 score, RMSE, RÂ², etc.                      |
# | Save Trained Model      | Dumps the model object for future prediction (`model.pkl`)                |
